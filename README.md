# Explainable Encrypted Traffic Intrusion Detection

This repository accompanies a BSc dissertation focused on assessing the
reliability and interpretability of machine learning models for encrypted
network traffic intrusion detection.

## Overview
- Flow-level metadata only (privacy-preserving)
- Random Forest and XGBoost models
- Explainability using SHAP and LIME
- Confidence-aware interpretation of alerts
